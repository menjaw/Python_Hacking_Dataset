# Python_Hacking_Dataset
 
Every cyber crime committed by the same hacker or hacking group has unique characteristics such as attack purpose, 
attack methods, and target’s profile. 

Therefore, a complete analysis of the hacker’s activities can give investigators hard evidence to attribute attacks and unveil criminals. 
To foster further research, we release the web-hacking case dataset we have collected. 


The data set consists of a database which includes 212.093 web-hacking cases that happend during the past 15 years.

The data set is avaiable here: http://ocslab.hksecurity.net/Datasets/web-hacking-profiling

Data will be downloadet in an Excel sheet and you have to fix the sheet before it is possible to work properly with the data.
Avaiable information are:  Date, Notify, URL, IP, Country, OS, Webserver, Encoding, Lang

Questions:
1. Which country has been the most attacked?
2. Which OS has been the most attacked?
3. Which webserver is the most attacked?
4. In which year was the attack highest?
5. Is there a common purpose in the attacking methods?
